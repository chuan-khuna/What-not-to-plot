# What not to plot

This repository is about charts that I have to create in a project.

Charts are designed by people who:

- don't listen to the suggestion from a data scientist.
- ignore the evidence and reasons to change

---

As a data scientist, I don't know why I have to deliberately create bad charts.

I try to show the worst case scenario of their design.
